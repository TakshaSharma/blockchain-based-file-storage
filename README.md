# Decentralized File Storage using IPFS

This project aims to provide a decentralized file storage solution leveraging the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS). IPFS is a protocol and network designed to create a content-addressable, peer-to-peer method of storing and sharing hypermedia in a distributed file system.

## Introduction

Traditional file storage systems rely on centralized servers, making them vulnerable to censorship, single points of failure, and data loss. Decentralized file storage, on the other hand, distributes files across a network of nodes, ensuring redundancy, fault tolerance, and resistance to censorship.

This project utilizes IPFS, a decentralized storage protocol, to offer a scalable, secure, and censorship-resistant file storage solution. Files uploaded to the system are broken into chunks, encrypted (optional), and distributed across multiple nodes in the IPFS network. Users can retrieve files using their unique content address, ensuring data integrity and availability.

## Features

- *Decentralized Storage*: Files are distributed across a network of nodes, eliminating single points of failure.
- *Content Addressing*: Files are accessed using their unique content address, ensuring integrity and availability.
- *Cryptography*: Optional encryption ensures data privacy and security.
- *Scalability*: The system can scale horizontally as more nodes join the network.
- *Censorship Resistance*: Files cannot be easily censored or removed once uploaded to the network.
